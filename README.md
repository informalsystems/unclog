# unclog

**Unclog your changelog**

Build your changelog from a structured collection of independent files in your
project's `.changelog` folder. This helps avoid annoying merge conflicts when
working on multiple PRs simultaneously.

It's assumed your changelog will be output in **Markdown** format.

## Requirements

* Rust v1.52.1+ with `cargo`

## Installation

```bash
# Install to ~/.cargo/bin/
cargo install unclog
```

## Usage

### Example `.changelog` folder

An example layout for a project's `.changelog` folder is as follows:

```
.changelog/                - The project's .changelog folder, in the root of the repo.
|__ unreleased/            - Changes to be released in the next version.
|   |__ breaking-changes/  - "BREAKING CHANGES" section entries.
|   |   |__ 890-block.md   - An entry in the "BREAKING CHANGES" section.
|   |
|   |__ bug-fixes/         - "BUG FIXES" section entries.
|   |__ features/          - "FEATURES" section entries.
|   |
|   |__ summary.md         - A summary of the next release.
|
|__ v0.1.0/                - Changes released historically in v0.1.0.
|   |__ breaking-changes/  - "BREAKING CHANGES" section entries for v0.1.0.
|   |   |__ 467-api.md     - An entry in the "BREAKING CHANGES" section for v0.1.0.
|   |   |__ 479-rpc.md     - Another entry in the "BREAKING CHANGES" section for v0.1.0.
|   |
|   |__ bug-fixes/         - "BUG FIXES" section entries for v0.1.0.
|   |
|   |__ summary.md         - A summary of release v0.1.0.
|
|__ epilogue.md            - Any content to be added to the end of the generated CHANGELOG.
```

### CLI

Once you've installed the `unclog` binary:

```bash
# Run from your project's directory to build your '.changelog' folder.
# Builds your CHANGELOG.md and writes it to stdout.
unclog

# Save the output as your new CHANGELOG.md file.
unclog > CHANGELOG.md

# Get help
unclog --help
```

### As a Library

By default, the `cli` feature is enabled, which builds the CLI. To use `unclog`
as a library instead without the CLI:

```toml
[dependencies]
unclog = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false }
```

# unclog

**Unclog your changelog**

Build your changelog from a structured collection of independent files in your
project's `.changelog` folder. This helps avoid annoying merge conflicts when
working on multiple PRs simultaneously.

## Requirements

* Rust v1.52.1+ with `cargo`

## Installation

```bash
# Install to ~/.cargo/bin/
cargo install unclog
```

## Usage

### CLI

Once you've installed the `unclog` binary:

```bash
# Run from your project's directory to build your '.changelog' folder.
# Builds your CHANGELOG.md and writes it to stdout.
unclog

# Save the output as your new CHANGELOG.md file.
unclog > CHANGELOG.md

# Get help
unclog --help
```

### As a Library

By default, the `cli` feature is enabled, which builds the CLI. To use `unclog`
as a library instead without the CLI:

```toml
[dependencies]
unclog = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false }
```

# unclog

**Unclog your changelog**

Build your changelog from a structured collection of independent files in your
project's `.changelog` folder. This helps avoid annoying merge conflicts when
working on multiple PRs simultaneously.

It's assumed your changelog will be output in **Markdown** format.

## Requirements

* Rust v1.52.1+ with `cargo`

## Installation

```bash
# Install to ~/.cargo/bin/
cargo install unclog
```

Or you can build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/informalsystems/unclog
cd unclog

# Install to ~/.cargo/bin/
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

### Example `.changelog` folder

An example layout for a project's `.changelog` folder is as follows:

```
.changelog/                - The project's .changelog folder, in the root of the repo.
|__ unreleased/            - Changes to be released in the next version.
|   |__ breaking-changes/  - "BREAKING CHANGES" section entries.
|   |   |__ 890-block.md   - An entry in the "BREAKING CHANGES" section.
|   |
|   |__ bug-fixes/         - "BUG FIXES" section entries.
|   |__ features/          - "FEATURES" section entries.
|   |
|   |__ summary.md         - A summary of the next release.
|
|__ v0.1.0/                - Changes released historically in v0.1.0.
|   |__ breaking-changes/  - "BREAKING CHANGES" section entries for v0.1.0.
|   |   |__ 467-api.md     - An entry in the "BREAKING CHANGES" section for v0.1.0.
|   |   |__ 479-rpc.md     - Another entry in the "BREAKING CHANGES" section for v0.1.0.
|   |
|   |__ bug-fixes/         - "BUG FIXES" section entries for v0.1.0.
|   |
|   |__ summary.md         - A summary of release v0.1.0.
|
|__ epilogue.md            - Any content to be added to the end of the generated CHANGELOG.
```

### CLI

#### Initializing a changelog

```bash
# Creates a ".changelog" folder in the current directory.
unclog init

# Creates a ".changelog" folder in the current directory, and also copies your
# existing CHANGELOG.md into it as an epilogue (to be appended at the end of
# the final changelog built by unclog).
unclog init -e CHANGELOG.md
```

#### Building a changelog

```bash
# Run from your project's directory to build your '.changelog' folder.
# Builds your CHANGELOG.md and writes it to stdout.
unclog build

# Save the output as your new CHANGELOG.md file.
# NOTE: All logging output goes to stderr.
unclog build > CHANGELOG.md

# Increase output logging verbosity on stderr and build your `.changelog`
# folder.
unclog -v build

# Get help
unclog --help
```

#### Releasing a new version's change set

```bash
# Moves all entries in your ".changelog/unreleased" folder to
# ".changelog/v0.2.0" and ensures the ".changelog/unreleased" folder is empty.
unclog release v0.2.0
```

### As a Library

By default, the `cli` feature is enabled, which builds the CLI. To use `unclog`
as a library instead without the CLI:

```toml
[dependencies]
unclog = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false }
```
